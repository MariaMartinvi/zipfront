For psychological analysis, chats are anonymized and fragmented on your device before being sent to Microsoft Azure. We only send a fragment of around 20-50k characters. We send chats without personal data. You can review our privacy policy for more details. If you still prefer that no data leaves your device, you can choose the 'no psychological analysis' option when uploading the file.",
